### Why This Interests Me

This article interests me because it represents a fundamental shift in how software development is practiced. The fact that 100% of code at companies like Anthropic and OpenAI is now AI-written means that AI-assisted development tools are not just assisting but completely replacing conventional coding workflows. 

What intrigues me the most is the potential impact this will have on the future of software engineering education. If the companies building the most advanced AI systems are already fully reliant on AI for code generation, it raises important questions about what skills will be most valuable for developers in the coming years. It seems like it's high time for CS education to shift it's emphasis toward system design, prompt engineering, code review, and understanding how to effectively collaborate with AI tools.
