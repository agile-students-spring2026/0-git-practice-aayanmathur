# Interesting Article on AI in Software Development

["100% of code at Anthropic and OpenAI is now AI-written"](https://fortune.com/2026/01/29/100-percent-of-code-at-anthropic-and-openai-is-now-AI-written-boris-cherny-roon/) - Fortune, January 29, 2026

This article fascinates me because while everybody knows that AI-generated code is being used heavily across the software industry, this article reveals something far more dramatic: leading AI companies have reached 100% AI-written code. There's a significant difference between "using AI assistance for coding" and "all code is AI-written". The latter represents a complete paradigm shift rather than just an incremental improvement in developer productivity. The fact that the organizations building the most sophisticated AI systems have crossed this threshold suggests we're witnessing a fundamental transformation in software development methodology, not just an adoption of helpful tools.

What strikes me most is the potential impact this has on the future of software engineering education and careers. As a computer science student, this challenges me to think critically about what I'm learning and what skills will actually matter in a few years. If the companies at the cutting edge are already fully reliant on AI for code generation, it raises important questions about whether traditional coding skills will remain relevant, or if the focus should shift entirely toward system design, prompt engineering, architecture decisions, and AI collaboration.
